Import posts, comments, tags, attachments, and audio from a Posterous.com blog.

== Description ==

Import posts, comments, tags, attachments, **embeds** and **audio** from a Posterous.com blog.

Posterous XML plugin uses the WXR file generated by Posterous. It also
uses the Posterous API to fetch embedded audio and other embedded files. It will gracefully
stop using the API after April 30th. It's based on the WordPress
importer with changes to fix URLs, fix embeds and fetch embedded
audio.

**NOTE:** Posterous is shutting down on April 30, and this plugin will no longer function properly because it relies on the service being available. For more information on backing up your Posterous content and migrating what you can into your WordPress blog, please see [this post](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/posterous-shutting-down?replies=1).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `posterous-importer-advanced` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to the Tools -> Import screen, Click on Posterous

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How is this different than the other Posterous importer by Automattic? =
With Posterous closing down soon, you will want to retreive all your data and include it in your blog. This importer will pull in all of that embeded data and audio to your uploads folder.
Also we've done alot of bugfixing and optimizing to scale to very large imports.

= What happens after Posterous closes down on April 30th? =
The plugin is designed out of the box to gracefully handle the shutdown after April 30th.
